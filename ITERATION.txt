Last week we recieved feedback on our tutorial being difficult to follow and would be better if it waited for players to make actions. For this,
we implemented a new tutorial system which waits for players to act before progressing to later stages. We also recieved feedback on some
aspects of our control systems, such as overly aggressive units. We implemented some quality of life updates to this system to 
make clicks more responsive and Unit AI more respectful of player input. We also added visual updates to our units, 
to give the 2D sprites more feeling, and we will continue to improve this as we finalize our games theming with the terrain and art.
