We had issues with our tutorial instructions in the gold spike, in particular specifying which units were which.
We implemented distinct unit sprites and behaviors to respond to this.
Some people found the controls overly manual, we implemented a better friendly unit AI to make this easier.
One person also wanted to be able to drag motion on the ground like in league, this was also implemented.
Overall, we were told the game was fun, but unpolished and more of a tech demo, this milestone is expanded into a proper game with art style and more polished controls and mechanics.
